# four-part-harmony
This will eventually generate four part harmonies in c major using common practice rules
Currently it can generate...
  ...random triad chord progressions (with an authentic cadence ending)
  ...a bass voice from the chords and their inversions
  ...and a soprano voice that follows most of the rules of counterpoint melody
